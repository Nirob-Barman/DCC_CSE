### What Is OpenGL?

OpenGL is an application programming interface---‘‘API’’ for short---which is
merely a software library for accessing features in graphics hardware.
Version 4.3 of the OpenGL library (which this text covers) contains over
500 distinct commands that you use to specify the objects, images, and
operations needed to produce interactive three-dimensional computergraphics applications.
