1) Design and develop a reprogrammable embedded computer using 8051 Microcontroller

2(a) Configure timer control registers of 8051 and develop a program to generate delay

2(b) use of general purpose Input/Output port of two controllers for data transfer

3(a) Simulate Binary counter (8 bits) on LED's

3(b) To interface 8 LEDs at input-output ports and create different patterns

3(c) To demonstrate timer working in and blink LED without using any loop delay routine

4(a) Serial I/O: Configure 8051 Serial port for asynchronous Serial Communication

4(b) To demonstrate seven segment LED display and generate4 counting from 0 to 99
